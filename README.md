## How to Use

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t solana-rust-dev .
````

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -it --rm solana-rust-dev
```

This will open a Bash shell in a clean Solana development environment.

* * *

## Commands Overview

Once inside the container, you can immediately start working:

```bash
# Rust compiler
rustc --version

# Solana CLI
solana --version

# Anchor CLI (via AVM)
anchor --version

# SPL Token CLI
spl-token --help

# Metaboss NFT utility
metaboss --help
```

You can also manage Anchor versions using AVM:

```bash
avm ls-remote
avm install 0.29.0
avm use 0.29.0
```

* * *

## Docker Hub Usage

To publish your image to Docker Hub and use it from anywhere:

### Create Dockerfile

Write your build instructions:

```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

### Build Docker Image

```bash
sudo docker build -f Dockerfile -t yourdockerhubuser/image-name .
```

### Login to Docker Hub

```bash
sudo docker login -u <username>
```

### Push the Image

```bash
sudo docker push yourdockerhubuser/image-name
```

### Pull the Image

```bash
sudo docker pull yourdockerhubuser/image-name
```

### Start the Container

```bash
sudo docker run -it yourdockerhubuser/image-name bash
```

## Cleanup & Optimization

* The image is configured with `noninteractive` frontend to avoid manual prompts during package installation.
* `apt clean`, `autoremove`, and `autoclean` help reduce the image size.
